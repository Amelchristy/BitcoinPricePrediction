# Project-3
Bitcoin Price Prediction

Our group aims to predict Bitcoin prices in the marketplace using historical data and machine learning.  Social media provides benefits to the increase in bitcoin prices, so we would like to examine the trend between this social media and the price as well. 
We are using Kaggle for our data sources.

Libraries we are planning to use:
Python Matplotlib
HTML/CSS
SciKitLearn
Karas
Javascript D3
